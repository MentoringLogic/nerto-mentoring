# Testing Task


You get a small piece of big production system, and you need to cover CommentService with tests.
Feel free for changing source code and adding new abstractions, but with few restrictions:
1. Do not change bussinnes logic (validation, calculation, etc.)
2. Do not remove static modification from CommentStore
3. Do not change App.Legacy -> Program.cs file

Build should be still successful after all your work.
